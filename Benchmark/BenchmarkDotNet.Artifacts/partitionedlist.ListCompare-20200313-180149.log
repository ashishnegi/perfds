// Validating benchmarks:
Benchmark ListCompare.SystemListAddOnly returns a deferred execution result (IEnumerable<Int32>). You need to either change the method declaration to return a materialized result or consume it on your own. You can use .Consume() extension method to do that.
Benchmark ListCompare.PartitionedListAddOnly returns a deferred execution result (IEnumerable<Int32>). You need to either change the method declaration to return a materialized result or consume it on your own. You can use .Consume() extension method to do that.
